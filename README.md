# React Tic-tac-toe
My attempt at building an interactive tic-tac-toe game using react.
My app includes one game file with three seperate componenets included for readability. 
Known issues:
Flawed winner logic - certain winning combinations will not trigger a winning state.
No state for a tie game.
No way to reset the board.
